        <h2 id="proof-by-contradiction">Proof by Contradiction</h2>

<p>Proving things by contradiction is a great feeling. You assume the negation is true, and then show that something breaks. Then, you go “Ha! See? There’s no way the negation is true, so the original statement must be true.”</p>

<p>We start off with some new terminology needed for this section. Then, we demonstrate an example proof, and explain that proofs by contradiction show up frequently in reality.</p>

<h3 id="contradictions-and-bottoms">Contradictions and Bottoms</h3>

<p>We use the <em>bottom</em> symbol, <script type="math/tex">\bot</script>, to represent a statement that must be false. For example, “2 is an odd number” is such a statement.
A <em>contradiction</em> is any statement of the form <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A</script>, where <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a statement. For example,
“2 is prime and 2 is not prime” is a contradiction, where <script type="math/tex">A</script>, in this case, is the statement “2 is prime”.</p>

<p>Like many things in math, there is an opposite to <script type="math/tex">\bot</script>. A <em>tautology</em> is a statement that must be true. For example, “2 is an even number” is such a statement.
We denote tautologies using the <em>top</em> symbol, <script type="math/tex">\top</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Contradictions are statements that must be false. That is, consider a statement <script type="math/tex">A</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A \equiv \bot</script>.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Consider the negation of the left-hand side. By De Morgan’s law, we have <script type="math/tex">\neg (A \wedge \neg A) \equiv (\neg A) \vee A \equiv A \Rightarrow A</script>.
Showing <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow A</script> must be true is easy: assume <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true. Then, <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true by assumption. Thus, <script type="math/tex">\neg (A \wedge \neg A) \equiv \top</script>. Negate both sides.
Then, <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A \equiv \bot</script>.</p>

<p>For fun, we introduce <em>the principle of explosion</em> to show why contradictions are bad:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Assume <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A</script> is true. Then, <em>any</em> statement <script type="math/tex">B</script> must be true. This fact is called the principle of explosion.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Assume <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A</script> is true. We claim <script type="math/tex">(A \Rightarrow B) \vee ((\neg A) \Rightarrow B) \equiv \top</script>.<br />
<em>Proof of claim</em>: <script type="math/tex">(A \Rightarrow B) \vee ((\neg A) \Rightarrow B) \equiv ((\neg A) \vee B) \vee (A \vee B) \equiv (\neg A) \vee A \vee B \equiv B \vee (A \Rightarrow A)</script>.
We have shown <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow A \equiv \top</script>, so <script type="math/tex">(A \Rightarrow B) \vee ((\neg A) \Rightarrow B) \equiv B \vee (A \Rightarrow A) \equiv B \vee \top \equiv \top</script>.<br />
Now, since <script type="math/tex">A \wedge \neg A</script> is true, both <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">\neg A</script> are true. We have shown that <script type="math/tex">(A \Rightarrow B) \vee ((\neg A) \Rightarrow B)</script> is a tautology, 
meaning that at least one of the implications must hold. Since both <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">\neg A</script> are true, then either <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B</script> holds, and <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true implies <script type="math/tex">B</script> is true, or
<script type="math/tex">(\neg A) \Rightarrow B</script> holds, and <script type="math/tex">\neg A</script> is true implies <script type="math/tex">B</script> is true. Thus, in either case, <script type="math/tex">B</script> must be true, no matter what statement <script type="math/tex">B</script> is! <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>Now, we introduce the proof by contradiction technique. Suppose we wanted to show <script type="math/tex">A</script> is false. Then, we negate <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and try to show the negation results in a contradiction.
If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is not an implication, the contradiction would come in the form of contradicting an earlier result, axiom, or theorem that was already proven.
If <script type="math/tex">A</script> <em>is</em> an implication, then the contradiction could either come in the same way as before, or the following:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Suppose <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true, and we want to show <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B</script>, but when we assume <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B</script> is true, we conclude <script type="math/tex">A</script> is false. 
That is, <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow \neg A</script> is true. Then, <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B</script> must be false.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true, and <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow \neg A</script> is true. Then, 
<script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow \neg A \equiv \neg A \vee (B \Rightarrow \neg A) \equiv \neg A \vee (A \Rightarrow \neg B)</script>, by contrapositive. We assumed <script type="math/tex">A</script> is true, so <script type="math/tex">\neg A</script> is
false. Thus, it must be that <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow \neg B</script> is true, meaning <script type="math/tex">(\neg A) \vee (\neg B)</script> is true. Thus, <script type="math/tex">A \wedge B</script> is false, by De Morgan’s law, so <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> cannot
both be true at the same time. Thus, <script type="math/tex">A \Rightarrow B</script> must be false. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-need-an-example">What? I need an example</h3>

<p>Fair. It took me until the end of second year to get comfortable with contradiction proofs.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: There is no largest natural number.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Assume there existed a largest natural number, denoted <script type="math/tex">n</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">m + 1 > m</script> for all <script type="math/tex">m \in \mathbb{N}</script>, and for <script type="math/tex">m \in \mathbb{N}</script>, <script type="math/tex">m + 1 \in \mathbb{N}</script>,
so <script type="math/tex">n + 1</script> is a natural number larger than <script type="math/tex">n</script>. Thus, <script type="math/tex">n</script> is the largest natural number, and it is not the largest natural number, a contradiction. Thus, <script type="math/tex">n</script> cannot exist. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>Note that if we accepted the contradiction, then by the principle of explosion, we would have been able to prove <em>anything</em>, including every statement and its negation, were all true.
In other words, if there was a largest natural number, then <script type="math/tex">1 = 0</script>, “which is absurd”, as one of my professors liked to say. Thus, we had to get rid of the contradiction, which was caused by
assuming the negation of the theorem was true. To do this, we declared that the negation of the theorem was false, and so proved indirectly that the original theorem must be true.</p>

<p>Another fun example of proving by contradiction comes up in group theory. Since I do not want to explain group theory, we consider the Rubik’s cube, instead.
A regular 3x3x3 Rubik’s cube has exactly <script type="math/tex">P = 2^{11}3^{7}\frac{12!}{2}8!</script> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube#Permutations">permutations</a>.
By Lagrange’s Theorem, if we start with a solved cube, consider any sequence of moves <script type="math/tex">A</script>, and execute such sequence repeatedly until the cube is solved again, 
the number of times we execute the sequence must divide <script type="math/tex">P</script>. Thus, no algorithm can possibly leave a solved cube still solved upon being executed 17 times.
Assume for a contradiction that such an algorithm existed. Then, by Lagrange’s theorem, 17 divides <script type="math/tex">P = 2^{11}3^{7}\frac{12!}{2}8!</script>, which is absurd, 
because there is no prime factor of 17 in <script type="math/tex">P</script> (17 is a prime number). Thus, no such algorithm can exist.</p>

<h3 id="proving-by-contradiction-in-real-life">Proving by contradiction in real life</h3>

<p>Proving a contradiction in real life is equivalent to detecting lies, or picking a side.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if it’s now evening, and your roommate says they will be studying for the whole evening, 
but then you hear them screaming over a game of LoL two minutes later, then the statement “My roommate is studying for the whole evening” is false, 
because there is evidence that your roommate isn’t studying for the whole evening.
Accepting both their original claim and the current evidence results in a contradiction, leading you to throw out the case that is more unlikely, which in this case is their claim.</p>

<p>For me, cognitive dissonance also arises from seeing or hearing contradicting beliefs within a short gap of time from two different people, or even from the same person.
Sometimes, I might state contradictory thoughts while freewriting on a page, such as “I think having <script type="math/tex">X</script> as a hobby is so cool…<script type="math/tex">X</script> is so lame, though”.
In this case, if I can catch myself writing down such a contradiction, then I can think about which opinion resonates more with me, and pick that one. I can also try to track down the
inspiration for each side. For example, my parents might believe in one opinion, but my friends might believe in another. Then, the final opinion comes down to whom I agree with more.</p>

<p>Quantifiers help shape your theorems and/or thoughts, especially when you’re looking over a group of people, or a range of possible values in the hypothesis or conclusion of an implication.
