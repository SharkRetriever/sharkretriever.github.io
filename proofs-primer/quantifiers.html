        <h2 id="quantifiers">Quantifiers</h2>

<p>Quantifiers such as the universal quantifier <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> and the existential quantifier <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> (and sometimes the uniqueness quantifier <script type="math/tex">\exists!</script>) help shape the scope of your argument. 
In practice, the first one is read as “for all”, and the second one is read as “there exists” (and <script type="math/tex">\exists!</script> is read as “there exists an unique…”).
To see how to analyze all-or-nothing thinking and confirmation bias with quantifiers, scroll to the bottom. 
Otherwise, enjoy reading through all the mathematical details about how to parse these statements!</p>

<p>We first consider the symbols individually:</p>

<h3 id="the-universal-quantifer-forall-and-its-relation-to-and">The universal quantifer <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> and its relation to AND</h3>

<p>Consider the statement “<script type="math/tex">x</script> is divisible by 2”. If the statement is true, then <script type="math/tex">x</script> is restricted to being an even number. But, <script type="math/tex">x</script> can still be <em>any</em> even number, and the statement would hold.
Thus, we can write “For all <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{Z}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x</script> is even, <script type="math/tex">x</script> is divisible by 2”, which is a true statement. If we did not write the first clause of that statement, 
we could consider <script type="math/tex">x</script> to be anything, such as <script type="math/tex">3</script>, which would render the statement false. Thus, by using “for all”, we limit the truthfulness of the statement to all elements of a given set.
The set of even numbers is infinite, so it does not seem like we are “limiting” the scope much, but consider the fact that the theorem fails for all odd numbers, which is also an infinite set.
Note that we have the symbol <script type="math/tex">\forall</script>, so we can rewrite the statement as “<script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x</script> is even, <script type="math/tex">x</script> is divisible by 2”. 
The symbol <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> is read as “for all”.</p>

<p>In general, statements using <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> are of the form “<script type="math/tex">\forall x \in X</script> such that (something about <script type="math/tex">x</script>), (some conclusion) holds”, where <script type="math/tex">X</script> is some set.</p>

<p>Here’s another example: <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^2 \ge 0</script>. This statement is true. 
Yet the statement <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^2 \gt 0</script> is false (disproof left as an exercise for the reader).</p>

<p>We have that <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> is closely related to AND. Consider the statement <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^2 \ge 0</script>. Then, we have
<script type="math/tex">\cdots \wedge ((-1)^2 \ge 0) \wedge (0^2 \ge 0) \wedge (1^2 \ge 0) \wedge \cdots</script>, which can be written compactly as
<script type="math/tex">\bigwedge_{x \in \mathbb{Z}} (x^2 \ge 0)</script>.</p>

<h3 id="the-existential-quantifier-exists-its-relation-to-or">The existential quantifier <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> its relation to OR</h3>

<p>Consider the statement “<script type="math/tex">x</script> is such that <script type="math/tex">x + 1 = 4</script>”. If the statement is true, then <script type="math/tex">x</script> must be <script type="math/tex">3</script>. That is the only possible answer that makes the statement true. We can write
“There exists <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{Z}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x + 1 = 4</script>”.</p>

<p>Thus, “there exists”, in a truthful statement, indicates that <em>at least one</em> solution exists that makes the statement true. The symbol <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> is read as “there exists”.
In general, statements using <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> are of the form “<script type="math/tex">\exists x \in X</script> such that (something about <script type="math/tex">x</script>) holds”. 
Another symbol that often appears with <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> is <script type="math/tex">:</script>, which means “such that”, so we can reduce the statement further to “<script type="math/tex">\exists x \in X :</script> (something about <script type="math/tex">x</script>) holds”.</p>

<p>Using the example above, we can write <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{Z} : x + 1 = 4</script>, which is a true statement. However, <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{R} : x^2 \lt 0</script> is false 
(again, disproof left as an exercise for the reader).</p>

<p>Whereas <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> is related to AND, <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> is related to OR. Consider the statement <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{Z} : x + 1 = 4</script>. Then, this means
<script type="math/tex">\cdots \vee (2 + 1 = 4) \vee (3 + 1 = 4) \vee (4 + 1 = 4) \vee \cdots</script>, which can be written compactly as
<script type="math/tex">\bigvee_{x \in \mathbb{Z}} (x + 1 = 4)</script>.</p>

<p>In fact, for this statement, since <script type="math/tex">3</script> is the <em>only</em> solution, we can say “There exists a <em>unique</em> <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{Z}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x + 1 = 4</script>. Writing this down, we have
“<script type="math/tex">\exists! x \in \mathbb{Z} : x + 1 = 4</script>”. We call <script type="math/tex">\exists!</script> the <em>uniqueness quantifier</em>.</p>

<h3 id="proving-theorems-with-quantifiers">Proving theorems with quantifiers</h3>

<p>To prove a statement with a <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in X</script>, one must consider all possible <script type="math/tex">x \in X</script>. Thus, the proof will contain the phrase “let <script type="math/tex">x \in X</script>”, 
but the proof will not specify a specific value for <script type="math/tex">x</script>. For example,</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x + 10 \ge 0</script>.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Let <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{N}</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">x \ge 1 \Rightarrow x + 10 \ge 11 \ge 0 \Rightarrow x \ge 0</script>. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>(Note to readers in computer science: we are assuming <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script> starts from 1, not 0.)</p>

<p>To prove a statement with a <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in X</script> fragment, one only needs to choose any <script type="math/tex">x</script> that satisfies the equation. There could be multiple choices. For example,</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 = 9</script>.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Choose <script type="math/tex">x = 3</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">x^2 = 3^2 = 9</script>. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>The proof would have been just as valid had we chosen <script type="math/tex">x = -3</script>.</p>

<p>To prove a statement with a <script type="math/tex">\exists! x \in X</script> fragment, one must first find any solution, and then demonstrate that any attempts to find a different solution either lead to the same solution,
or a contradiction. These proofs are harder to write. For example:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\exists! x \in \mathbb{N}: x^2 = x</script>.<br />
<strong>Proof</strong>: Choose <script type="math/tex">x = 1 \in \mathbb{N}</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">1^2 = 1</script>. Now, assume for a contradiction that there exists <script type="math/tex">y \in \mathbb{N}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">y \ne 1</script> but <script type="math/tex">y^2 = y</script>. Then,
<script type="math/tex">y</script> must be strictly greater than 1. For <script type="math/tex">y \ge 2</script>, <script type="math/tex">y \gt 0</script> and <script type="math/tex">y \gt 1 \Rightarrow y - 1 \gt 0</script> imply <script type="math/tex">y(y - 1) \gt 0 \Rightarrow y^2 - y \gt 0 \Rightarrow y^2 \gt y</script>.
Thus, <script type="math/tex">y^2</script> cannot equal <script type="math/tex">y</script>, a contradiction. Thus, no such <script type="math/tex">y</script> can exist. Therefore, <script type="math/tex">x = 1</script> is the only solution. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<h3 id="disproving-theorems-with-quantifiers">Disproving theorems with quantifiers</h3>

<p>Using De Morgan’s law and the relationship between <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> and AND, and <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> and OR, we have the following, where <script type="math/tex">P(x)</script> is a statement involving <script type="math/tex">x</script>:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p><script type="math/tex">\neg (\forall x \in X, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \in X : \neg P(x)</script><br />
<script type="math/tex">\neg (\exists x \in X: P(x)) \equiv \forall x \in X : \neg P(x)</script></p>
</div>

<p>For example, the negation of “it rains every day”, or equivalently, “for all days, it rains”, is “there exists a day such that it does not rain”, or equivalently, “it does not rain for some day (in the set of all days)”.
The negation of “there exists a day such that it rains” is “for all days, it does not rain”. We can use the following strategies to disprove statements, by showing their negation is true.
However, <em>we must remember to switch the quantifier around whenever we negate statements</em>.</p>

<p><strong>“Theorem”</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x \lt 0</script>.<br />
<strong>“Disproof”</strong>: Choose <script type="math/tex">x = 1 \in \mathbb{N}</script>. <script type="math/tex">x \gt 0</script>, a contradiction to <script type="math/tex">x \lt 0</script>. The statement is thus false.</p>

<p><strong>“Theorem”</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{N} : x \lt 0</script>.<br />
<strong>“Disproof”</strong>: Choose any <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{N}</script>. <em>By definition</em>, <script type="math/tex">x \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</script>, so <script type="math/tex">\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x \gt 0</script>. Thus, there cannot exist a single <script type="math/tex">x</script> such that
<script type="math/tex">x \lt 0</script>, so the statement is false.</p>

<p>Notice that for the first “theorem”, we disproved it by showing the negation is true. The negation is a “there exists” statement, which we proved by choosing a single value of <script type="math/tex">x</script>.
For the second “theorem”, the negation was a “for all” statement, so we could not pick any specific <script type="math/tex">x</script> – we had to consider all of them.</p>

<p>To disprove a statement about uniqueness, either we can show no solution exists at all, or more than one solution exists. If no solution exists at all, then the “disproof” is similar to the one above about the statement <script type="math/tex">\exists x \in \mathbb{N}, x \lt 0</script>. Otherwise, the counterexample may appear as follows:</p>

<p><strong>“Theorem”</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\exists! x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 = 9</script>.<br />
<strong>“Disproof”</strong>: Choose <script type="math/tex">x = 3</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">x^2 = 3^2 = 9</script>. But, choose <script type="math/tex">x = -3</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">x^2 = (-3)^2 = 9</script>. Thus, <script type="math/tex">x</script> is not unique, so the statement is false.</p>

<h3 id="quantifiers-in-math">Quantifiers in math</h3>

<p>By now, you might have figured out that the theorems on previous pages implicitly used a <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> quantifier. If you’re not sure, <a href="proof-by-definition.html">you can check</a>.
All theorems use quantifiers either implicitly or explicitly, and as a mathematician, it is almost always important to understand exactly which one is being used.</p>

<p>Here is an example of where knowing your quantifiers really helps:</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: We say <script type="math/tex">\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</script> if<br />
<script type="math/tex">\forall \varepsilon \gt 0 \ \exists \delta \gt 0</script> such that <script type="math/tex">0 \lt \|x - a\| \lt \delta \Rightarrow \|f(x) - L\| \lt \varepsilon</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\|x\|</script> denotes the absolute value of <script type="math/tex">x</script>.</p>

<p>Now, if we want to formally prove that <script type="math/tex">\lim_{x \to 3} x^2 = 9</script>, then we have to show that <script type="math/tex">\forall \varepsilon \gt 0 \ \exists \delta \gt 0</script> such that <script type="math/tex">0 \lt \|x - 3\| \lt \delta \Rightarrow \|x^2 - 9\| \lt \varepsilon</script>. <a href="https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-you-prove-that-the-limit-of-x-2-9-as-x-approaches-3-using-the-epsilon-del">Here is a proof</a>, in case you are wondering how such a task is even possible.</p>

<p>But, what does it mean to say <script type="math/tex">\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \ne L</script>, now? Well, we have to reverse that giant mess of quantifiers, by applying the equivalences above. We end up with the following:</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \ne L</script> if<br />
<script type="math/tex">\exists \varepsilon \gt 0</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\forall \delta \gt 0, 0 \lt \|x - a\| \lt \delta</script> but <script type="math/tex">\|f(x) - L\| \ge \varepsilon</script>.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve seen this definition, I hope you remembered how to negate your <a href="implications.html">implications</a>.</p>

<h3 id="quantifiers-in-all-or-nothing-thinking-and-confirmation-bias">Quantifiers in all-or-nothing thinking and confirmation bias</h3>

<p>All-or-nothing thinking is a type of thinking where someone only thinks in extremes.</p>

<p>Thus, they might think things such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Everyone is more sociable than me” (“for every human in the world, that human is more sociable than me”), or,</li>
  <li>“No one else likes 4D Rubik’s cubes” (“for every human in the world, that human does not like the 4D Rubik’s cube”).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, the person says statements only using <script type="math/tex">\forall</script>, or even worse, <script type="math/tex">\exists!</script>, where the only “solution” is them. An example of the latter is “I am the only one who actually cares about [list some cause here that has an entire organization dedicated to helping it]”, or in terms of <script type="math/tex">\exists!</script>, “<script type="math/tex">\exists!</script> human in the world that cares about [list some cause here that has an entire organization dedicated to helping it]. That human is <em>me</em>”.</p>

<p>Yet, another type of thought that is also annoying, especially when combined with all-or-nothing thinking, is confirmation bias. For example, I might see a single instance of someone who dropped out of university and then became a millionaire, and use that to conclude everyone who drops out of university becomes a millionaire.</p>

<p>Firstly, <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/10/21/the-myth-of-the-millionaire-college-dropout/">this fact is misleading</a>. Secondly, that type of thinking can be written as
<script type="math/tex">\exists x \in X : P(x) \Rightarrow \forall x \in X, P(x)</script>, for some statement <script type="math/tex">P</script> involving <script type="math/tex">x</script>. That’s almost always ridiculous, especially if <script type="math/tex">X</script>, such as the set of all people on the planet, is not a one-element set!</p>
