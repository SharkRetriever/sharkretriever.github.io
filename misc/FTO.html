<h3 id="general-puzzle-notes">General Puzzle Notes</h3>

<p>The FTO is much more interesting than its corner-turning relative, simply because the corner-turning variant reduces into a hybrid of a pyraminx and an edges-only 3x3x3, which makes it much easier to solve.</p>

<p>Solution found: Feb 26, 2016</p>

<h3 id="general-solving-overview">General Solving Overview</h3>

<p>The puzzle can be solved using just sledgehammer and sune.
We define sledgehammer as R’ L R L’ and sune as R U R’ U R U R’ U.
Of course, we can also use antisune (R’ U’ R U’ R’ U’ R U’) to help speed things up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>fix corners, using sledgehammer if needed</li>
  <li>fix centers using setup moves and sune and/or antisune</li>
  <li>fix edges using sune and/or antisune</li>
</ol>

<p>This is definitely not the most optimal solution, but it is quite nice since there are only two algorithms needed.</p>

<p>To perform these algorithms we must hold the puzzle such that for the U layer, an edge faces you. Thus, it should be possible to do ULRFD, and B is ambiguous. If F is ambiguous or looks more like FL/FR, you’re holding the puzzle wrong. Perhaps do a 1/2-y rotation.</p>

<h4 id="step-1-fix-corners">Step 1: Fix Corners</h4>

<p>The first layer (bottom layer) corners are very intuitive, especially if one knows how to solve the skewb.</p>

<p>Essentially, any corner can be picked to be the first corner and placed on the bottom layer. A second corner can be placed next to this one, using sledgehammer if necessary. The third corner is then placed as to complete the first layer corners, using sledgehammer if necessary.</p>

<p>To complete the second layer corners, we just need to orient them and AUF.</p>

<p>Find the colour that all second layer corners have in common. This colour will be the colour of the current U side. If only one corner is oriented, turn the puzzle so that the two unoriented corners are in the URF and DFR positions, and the oriented corner is in the FLU position. Then do sledgehammer. Then rotate the puzzle back and AUF.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-fix-centers">Step 2: Fix Centers</h4>

<p>This step is a bit harder. Any move is a valid setup move, although I recommend having setup moves of at most length 2, since otherwise it becomes harder to use the corners as a reference to help undo them.</p>

<p>What sune does is cycle the U-face centers 90 degrees clockwise. Likewise, antisune cycles the U-face centers 90 degrees counterclockwise.</p>

<p>The very first few centers can probably solved just by performing slice moves, but the centers afterwards will need the sunes and setup moves to complete. Of course, you want to make the setup moves such that after you do the sune and/or antisune, the center is in the proper face (use the corners as references) and that <em>undoing the setup move will not cause the center to just go back to its original position on the wrong face</em>. Thus,
the setup move needs to be chosen with some care, and so does the choice of whether the set-up center needs to go clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>

<p>Another tip especially good for bringing the last unsolved center of a side into that wanted (target) side is often first doing a sune or antisune on the target side first so that when the setup move is done, there is clearly a gap that the center can go to after the sune or antisune such that reversing the setup move does not just bring it out of the target side again. This is essentially like keyhole method for the 3x3x3, except we’re using sunes and antisunes to make the keyholes.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-fix-edges">Step 3: Fix Edges</h4>

<p>What sune does in this step is cycle the U-face edges 90 degrees clockwise. Likewise, antisune cycles the U-face edges 90 degrees counterclockwise.</p>

<p>Note that because the U-face centers are cycled too when using sune/antisune (we use this to our advantage in Step 2), we cannot use setup moves now. This means that we can only use cube rotations, making this step more tedious.</p>

<p>Just like in Step 2, the first few edges can likely be solved directly through one or more applications of sune. Later on though, we might need to use the “keyhole” technique where we purposely perform sune/antisune on a side with two solved edges so that even though that side is now more unsolved, the third unsolved edge can be placed into a solved position relative to the
first two edges more easily. Then, undoing the sune (or antisune) setup move completes the face.</p>
