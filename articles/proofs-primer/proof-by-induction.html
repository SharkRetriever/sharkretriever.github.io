        <h2 id="proof-by-induction">Proof by Induction</h2>

<p>Consider a statement of the form <script type="math/tex">\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)</script>, where <script type="math/tex">P</script> is a statement that has something to do with <script type="math/tex">n</script>.
For example, <script type="math/tex">P(n)</script> could be the statement <script type="math/tex">n + 1 \gt n</script>.</p>

<p>To prove such statements, we cannot directly analyze when <script type="math/tex">n = 1</script>, <script type="math/tex">n = 2</script>, and so on, since there an infinite number of such <script type="math/tex">n</script>,
and we have to show the statement holds for all of them (notice the <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> in front of the statement).</p>

<p>Thus, without knowing induction, the proof would start with a statement of the form “Let <script type="math/tex">n \in \mathbb{N}</script>”. Then, the proof would attempt to derive the rest of the statement.
Here is an example where such a strategy does not work well:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Show <script type="math/tex">\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</script>.</p>

<h3 id="a-line-of-dominos">A line of dominos</h3>

<p>Suppose on your table, you set up a line of fifty standing dominos. What does it take for all of them to tip over, assuming you don’t just flip the table?
There are two requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There exists an initial domino that tips over. In other words, you have a “starting domino” that you can push over.</li>
  <li>For every domino that tips over (including the initial domino), the next domino must also tip over.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these two requirements satisfied, we can push a domino on one end of the line (the initial domino), and that domino must push over the next domino in line, by the second requirement.
However, the second requirement now repeats on the second domino, and so the second domino must push over the third domino, and this continues until the last domino tips over.</p>

<p>Notice that no end point is specified. We do not actually need the “line” of dominos to have an ending point, but rather just a starting point. 
As long as the second property holds, after the first domino is tipped, any domino in line will fall.</p>

<p>Now, let the <script type="math/tex">n</script>-th domino represent <script type="math/tex">P(n)</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n</script> starts from <script type="math/tex">1</script>. Technically, <script type="math/tex">n</script> does not have to start from <script type="math/tex">1</script>, but for proving the theorems on this page, we start from <script type="math/tex">n = 1</script>. In computer science, do not be surprised if the lecturer or textbook starts <script type="math/tex">n</script> from <script type="math/tex">0</script>.</p>

<p>Assume <script type="math/tex">P(n)</script> is true if and only if the <script type="math/tex">n</script>-th domino falls. 
What does it take for <script type="math/tex">P(n)</script> to hold for all <script type="math/tex">n \in \mathbb{N}</script>? Well, we use the if and only if along with the requirements for the dominos to fall to our advantage, and state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">P(1)</script> must hold. In other words, <script type="math/tex">P(1)</script> is true.</li>
  <li>For all <script type="math/tex">k \in \mathbb{N}</script>, <script type="math/tex">P(k)</script> holds implies <script type="math/tex">P(k + 1)</script> holds.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can state these requirements in one line, using mathematical notation from previous pages:
<script type="math/tex">(P(1) \wedge \forall k \in \mathbb{N}, P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)) \Rightarrow \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)</script>.</p>

<h3 id="some-definitions">Some definitions</h3>

<p>Consider the implication above.</p>

<p>The technique of considering the two requirements, instead of arbitrarily selecting <script type="math/tex">n \in \mathbb{N}</script> and attempting to prove the rest of the statement, is called <em>proof by induction</em>.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">P(1)</script> is called the base case, and in the statement above, <script type="math/tex">P(k)</script> is called the inductive hypothesis, and <script type="math/tex">P(k+1)</script> is called the inductive conclusion.</p>

<p>In some later courses, the statement may be re-written as<br />
<script type="math/tex">(P(1) \wedge \forall k \in \mathbb{N}</script> such that <script type="math/tex">k > 1, P(k - 1) \Rightarrow P(k)) \Rightarrow \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)</script>.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-theorem">Back to the theorem</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <script type="math/tex">\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</script>.</p>

<p>If you have seen this theorem along with its proof before, then try showing <script type="math/tex">\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</script>.
If you have done that before too, then you probably know induction. See a section or two below for debugging tough induction homework questions.</p>

<p>Proof: First consider <script type="math/tex">n = 1</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^1 i = 1 = \frac{1(2)}{2}</script>, so the base case holds.<br />
Assume for some <script type="math/tex">k \ge 1</script> that <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}</script>. Then, we must show <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}</script>.
We have <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \sum_{i=1}^k i + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k + 1)</script>, by the inductive hypothesis. Thus,
<script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}</script>. Since this holds for any <script type="math/tex">k \ge 1</script>,
<script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</script> for all <script type="math/tex">n \in \mathbb{N}</script> by induction. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>For reference:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The base case was showing <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^1 i = 1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}</script>.</li>
  <li>The inductive hypothesis was assuming for some <script type="math/tex">k \ge 1</script> that <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}</script>.</li>
  <li>The inductive conclusion that we had to show, using the help of the inductive hypothesis, was <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}</script>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="induction-on-false-statements">Induction on false statements</h3>

<p>Attempting to use induction on false statements is dangerous. If you attempt to prove a false statement by induction, then one or more of the following might happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The base case does not hold</li>
  <li>The inductive hypothesis does not always imply the inductive conclusion (this is especially an issue for small <script type="math/tex">n</script>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_horses_are_the_same_color">this case</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="debugging-induction">Debugging induction</h3>

<p>Most induction questions are fairly simple, because they follow the pattern above. Just set up the base case, and make sure the inductive hypothesis implies the inductive conclusion.
If the induction question is difficult, it could be for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The question is not meant to be solved by induction. Try using another proof method that is more direct.</li>
  <li>The statement might be true only for odd or even numbers. Try showing <script type="math/tex">P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+2)</script> instead.</li>
  <li>The statement might be true only for powers of two. Rewrite <script type="math/tex">n</script> as <script type="math/tex">2^w</script> and use induction on <script type="math/tex">w \in \mathbb{N}</script>. This is a common pattern in CS.</li>
  <li>The inductive conclusion might need more information than just the inductive hypothesis. Consider splitting this part of the proof into cases, and analyzing each case.</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of this advice helped, then attempt to speak with a professor, classmate, or friend about your induction issues.
(If you got here while trying to search up how to fix an induction cooktop, you’re on the wrong site.)</p>
