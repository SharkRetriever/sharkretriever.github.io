        <h2 id="proof-by-definition">Proof by Definition</h2>

<p>We have seen a few examples of proving and disproving implications <a href="implications.html">last time</a>. However, the proofs, especially the one in the “self-analysis” section, seem arbitrary. In this article, we take some time to mention the importance of defining things both in math and in reality, before moving onwards to more proof constructs.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-in-math">Definitions in math</h3>

<p>Theorems and proofs cannot exist without one first defining what terms such as “divides” and “positive” means. <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{R}</script> is positive if <script type="math/tex">x</script> is greater than zero, but how should divisibility be defined?</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: For <script type="math/tex">a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</script>, we say <em><script type="math/tex">a</script> divides <script type="math/tex">b</script></em>, and write <script type="math/tex">a \mid b</script>, if <script type="math/tex">b = ac</script> for some <script type="math/tex">c \in \mathbb{Z}</script>.
(Note that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}</script> is the set of integers).</p>

<p>Notice that we have provided the term that we want to define, any assumptions we had to make before using the term (i.e. <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script> are integers), the notation the term uses, and lastly,
what the term means, using concepts that are simpler (i.e. <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script> satisfy some equation <script type="math/tex">b = ca</script> for some <script type="math/tex">c \in \mathbb{Z}</script>). We can now try to prove the following:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: If <script type="math/tex">a \in \mathbb{Z}</script> is divisible by <script type="math/tex">4</script>, then <script type="math/tex">a \in \mathbb{Z}</script> is divisible by <script type="math/tex">2</script>.</p>

<p>Actually, we cannot quite prove this yet. This theorem uses the term “divisible”, but we only defined “divides”. Let’s try something else first:</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: For <script type="math/tex">a, b \in \mathbb{Z}</script>, we say <em><script type="math/tex">a</script> is divisible by <script type="math/tex">b</script></em> if <script type="math/tex">b \mid a</script>.</p>

<p>There. Now let’s proceed to proving the theorem:</p>

<p><strong>Proof (of theorem)</strong>: Assume <script type="math/tex">a \in \mathbb{Z}</script> is divisible by <script type="math/tex">4</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">4 \mid a</script>, so <script type="math/tex">a = 4m</script> for some <script type="math/tex">m \in \mathbb{Z}</script>. Thus, <script type="math/tex">a = 4m = 2(2m)</script>, but <script type="math/tex">m \in \mathbb{Z}</script>, so
<script type="math/tex">2m \in \mathbb{Z}</script>. Let <script type="math/tex">l = 2m \in \mathbb{Z}</script>. Then, <script type="math/tex">a = 2l</script>, so <script type="math/tex">2 \mid a</script>, so <script type="math/tex">a</script> is divisible by <script type="math/tex">2</script>. <em>QED</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, we used the definition to first rewrite the statement into a more workable mathematical expression. Then, we manipulated the expression a little, and used the definition again to bring us to the conclusion. This is a common strategy in a first-year proofs course.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-in-self-analysis-and-reality">Definitions in self-analysis and reality</h3>

<p>The “theorem” from the last section went as follows:</p>

<p><strong>“Theorem”</strong>: If I did not get wasted last weekend, then I am a loser.</p>

<p><strong>“Proof”</strong>: “I did not get wasted last weekend” <script type="math/tex">\Rightarrow</script> “I decided not to go to any parties that weekend” <script type="math/tex">\Rightarrow</script> “I finished some assignments instead” <script type="math/tex">\Rightarrow</script> “I was a loser”.</p>

<p>We noted from <a href="implications.html">last time</a> that implications in real life require a point of view, or a <em>frame of reference</em>, to be considered true or false. Thus, an implication such as the one above could be true to you, and your proof might still look different. Or, the implication could be false, in which case you would provide a counterexample. In the example above, the last implication in the proof is false to me, but I realize it is true to some people whom I have interacted with before, and so I can conclude that the implication is true based on those people’s beliefs. Using this information, I can then focus more on who might have given me the opinion “studying is uncool”, and what I can do about it in the future.</p>

<p>However, some “proofs” hold for so many frames of reference that the implication becomes statistically significant, in which case correlation can be derived, and after a few more studies, causation. Thus, “If you smoke, then you are more likely to die from cancer than someone who does not smoke” is <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/the-study-that-helped-spur-the-us-stop-smoking-movement.html">one such implication</a>, with an example correlation study <a href="http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Hammond%20EC%20and%20Horn%20D%201958%20smoking%20and%20death%20rates%20-%20report%20on%2044%20months%20of%20follow-up.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, realize that definitions still play a role here. 
Implicitly, we have defined in the English language what it means “to smoke”, and the study defines what it means “to die from cancer”, i.e. to have a death certificate from a doctor with that cause ascribed to the death.</p>

<p>For self-analysis “proofs”, definitions are still important, but due to the specific frame of reference that the implication is in (that of the person doing the self-analysis), they have to ensure that they can define terms. For example, at what stage of drunkenness is it considered “getting wasted”, and what does it really mean to be a “loser”? 
Especially in the case of the latter, the definition varies so much from person to person, that attempting to define the word itself might as well become a debate topic.</p>

<p>Before I stir up any more controversy by attempting to suggest a definition, let us first consider the potentially pretentious phrase <a href="iff.html">“if and only if”</a>.</p>
