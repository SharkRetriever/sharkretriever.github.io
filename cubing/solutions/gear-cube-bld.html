<h3 id="general-puzzle-notes">General Puzzle Notes</h3>

<p>The Gear Cube is too easy on its own. It can be solved by accident.</p>

<h3 id="general-solving-overview">General Solving Overview</h3>

<p>Speffz will help for the third step. The second step requires the most tracking. Note that we never care about the centers, since solving the corners and the edges will solve the centers anyway. Also, the centers are moved around in Steps 2 to 4, so they are not reliable for tracking during memorization.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orient edges in the M, S, and E belts so that the puzzle is now in cube-shape</li>
  <li>Fix corners into one of two cases such that the edges are in the same slice that they would be in once the puzzle is solved</li>
  <li>Solve all edges</li>
  <li>Apply an algorithm to fix corners if needed</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>

<p><strong>Note that U, R, F all represent 180-degree turns, and x, y, z represent 90-degree rotations.</strong></p>

<h4 id="step-1-edge-orientation">Step 1: Edge Orientation</h4>

<p>To orient the edge gears <strong>in the M slice</strong>, we use one of two algs</p>

<ul>
  <li>If they are tilted to the right, do R4</li>
  <li>If they are tilted to the left, do R4’</li>
</ul>

<p>For orienting edge gears in other slices, do a cube rotation. Remember to undo the cube rotation after.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-fixing-corners">Step 2: Fixing Corners</h4>

<p>The corners can be fixed into one of the two positions always in two moves or less:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All corners are solved</li>
  <li>The U and D sides have their corners solved, but the other four faces have the corners in a checkerboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the second case, we’ll need to do step 4 later on.</p>

<p><strong>We orient the cube before execution so that after doing R3/R3’ and U3/U3’ turns accordingly, the corners end up in one of the two cases above.</strong>
I always try to get as many edges solved as I can in this step, and note that doing a 540-degree turn on any face of the gear cube seems to rotate that face by 180 degrees, but rotates the corresponding middle slice backwards by 90 degrees.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-solving-edges">Step 3: Solving Edges</h4>

<p>To swap the FU and FD edges (as though doing a F turn to solve those two M-slice edges), do <strong>Algorithm C1: U’ R6 U</strong>
Note that BU and BD are also swapped!</p>

<p>To swap any other pair of edges, do a cube rotation and perform that algorithm. Remember to undo the cube rotation after.</p>

<p>To swap FU with BD, we realize that this would be equivalent to doing M2 on a 3x3x3. Do <strong>Algorithm C2: R6</strong><br />
To do an equivalent to E2, S2 on a 3x3x3, do a cube rotation, R6, and undo.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-algorithm-fix-if-the-cube-hasnt-been-solved-yet">Step 4: Algorithm FIX [if the cube hasn’t been solved yet]</h4>

<p>If you have a case which looks equivalent to this on a 3x3x3:</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Case: the corners form a checkerboard pattern with the U and D faces solved. The diagonal line on the F face extends from DL to UR" width="300" /></p>

<p>do <strong>Algorithm FIX: U3 R3 F3’ R3’</strong>. Then, use Algorithm C1 with cube rotations in Step 3 to swap the RU and RD pieces, as well as the FR and FL pieces.</p>

<h3 id="memorizing-method">Memorizing Method</h3>

<p>I use Speffz, except I use “Y” instead of “X”.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/images/4/49/Speffz.png" alt="A diagram of the letters on a 7x7x7 cube" /></p>

<p>I first look at the corners and see which R and U turns would be needed to either solve the corners or place the corners in a checkerboard pattern. If it’s not possible, I rotate the cube so that I can place it in one of the two patterns using just R and U turns.</p>

<p>For the edge orientation, I memorize it in the order of M, S, E. Thus, if UF is tilted to the right, UR is solved orientation-wise, and FR is tilted to the left, I remember “ROL”. O stands for oriented.</p>

<p>I then see which of &lt;R3, R3’&gt; and/or &lt;U3, U3’&gt; would help me move as many of the edge pieces into place, and memorize accordingly. Since all turns are 540-degrees here, I just memorize the letter and direction. For example, if I had to do “R3 U3’” I would just memorize “R U’”</p>

<p>To solve the edges, note that Algorithm C1 visibly swaps the (Speffz) C and U stickers. It also swaps the A and W stickers. Thus, I associate <em>one</em> of the stickers that gets visibly swapped to the algorithm. This means that without cube rotations, I just memorize “Algorithm C1 swaps C”. In a real BLD solve, there would usually be up to two letters here, such as “DL”, which can be memorized, for example, as “DeL”. If I had to do Algorithm C2 on a slice, I would just memorize which slice would be affected, such as “S slice”, or “E slice”. This is going back to Rubik’s cube notation rather than Speffz.</p>

<p>Lastly, I note if Step 4 needs to be done. If it does, I make sure the cube is in the proper orientation beforehand. Since the corners will be in a checkerboard, referencing the corners to determine where to swap the edges gets confusing, so I use the LFD and LDB corners as reference to see where the other corners should go. Also remember that Algorithm FIX can be memorized quickly as <strong>U3 R3 F3’ R3’ BiP</strong> since Algorithm C1 is essentially used to swap B and P after!</p>
